# Product Requirements Document: AI Agent Orchestrator

## Introduction/Overview

This feature adds an AI-powered orchestrator to the existing code viewer application, transforming it into a complete "Vibe Coding" tool that can autonomously manage development workflows. The AI Agent will integrate with the current three-stage workflow (create-prd, generate-tasks, process-task-list) and provide a chat interface for interaction while maintaining the code viewing capabilities.

The primary goal is to enable hands-off development workflow automation where the AI can understand project requirements, break them down into tasks, and manage the implementation process with minimal human intervention.

## Goals

1. **Workflow Automation**: Enable fully automated execution of the create-prd → generate-tasks → process-task-list workflow
2. **Intelligent File Management**: Provide AI-driven file operations (create, read, modify, delete) with context awareness
3. **Enhanced User Interface**: Restructure the application layout to accommodate AI chat interface alongside existing code viewing
4. **Task Management Integration**: Allow AI to directly read, update, and manage task markdown files
5. **Seamless Integration**: Maintain existing code viewer functionality while adding AI capabilities

## User Stories

**As a developer, I want to:**
- Chat with an AI agent about my project so that I can get intelligent assistance with development workflows
- Have the AI automatically create PRDs from my high-level descriptions so that I don't need to manually structure requirements
- Let the AI generate and manage task lists automatically so that I can focus on actual implementation
- Have the AI mark tasks as complete when work is done so that project tracking stays current
- View my code, file tree, and chat with AI simultaneously so that I have all necessary tools in one interface
- Have the AI access and modify any files in my project so that it can make necessary changes autonomously

**As a project manager, I want to:**
- See automated task creation and completion tracking so that I can monitor progress without manual updates
- Have consistent PRD and task formatting so that documentation remains standardized

## Functional Requirements

### Core AI Integration
1. The system must integrate Pydantic AI with AzureProvider using credentials from .env file
2. The system must implement a chat interface for natural language interaction with the AI agent
3. The AI must have file system access with broader permissions (not sandboxed to project directory)
4. The AI must be able to create, read, modify, and delete files through an MCP (Model Context Protocol) interface

### Workflow Automation
5. The AI must automatically execute the create-prd workflow when given project requirements
6. The AI must automatically generate task lists from existing PRDs using the generate-tasks workflow
7. The AI must automatically process and update task lists using the process-task-list workflow
8. The AI must be able to mark individual tasks and subtasks as complete in markdown files
9. The AI must be able to create new tasks when they emerge during development

### User Interface Requirements
10. The application layout must be restructured to include three panels: file tree (left), code viewer (center), chat interface (right)
11. The chat interface must occupy the right panel with appropriate sizing and responsive design
12. The existing code viewer functionality must remain unchanged (read-only, syntax highlighting, line numbers)
13. The file tree navigation must remain fully functional in the left panel
14. Panel sizing must be adjustable with splitter controls

### File and Task Management
15. The AI must be able to read and parse existing task markdown files in the /tasks directory
16. The AI must be able to update task completion status by modifying checkbox syntax in markdown files
17. The AI must be able to create new PRD files following the existing naming convention (prd-[feature-name].md)
18. The AI must be able to create new task files following the existing naming convention (tasks-[prd-name].md)
19. The AI must maintain the "Relevant Files" section in task lists as files are created or modified

### Integration Requirements
20. The AI must integrate with the existing PyQt6 application architecture
21. The AI must respect the existing project structure and file organization rules
22. The AI must use the existing theme management system for consistent styling
23. The chat interface must follow the dark mode theme established in the application

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Code execution capabilities (planned for next PRD)
- Internet access and web search (planned for next PRD via MCP)
- Terminal command execution (planned for next PRD)
- Conversation history persistence across sessions (planned for next PRD)
- Code editing capabilities in the viewer (remains read-only)
- Real-time collaboration features
- AI model training or fine-tuning
- Custom AI model deployment

## Design Considerations

### Layout Structure
- **Left Panel (25%)**: File tree navigation (existing functionality)
- **Center Panel (45%)**: Code viewer with syntax highlighting (existing functionality)
- **Right Panel (30%)**: AI chat interface with message history and input field

### Chat Interface Design
- Message bubbles distinguishing user messages from AI responses
- Input field at the bottom with send button
- Scrollable message history area
- Consistent with existing dark theme styling
- Clear visual indicators for AI processing states

### Integration Points
- Chat interface must be a QWidget that integrates with existing QSplitter layout
- AI service must be initialized during application startup
- File MCP must be configured to work with existing file tree model
- Task management must integrate with existing file watching mechanisms

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- Add Pydantic AI to project dependencies
- Add Azure AI SDK for provider integration
- Ensure MCP libraries are available for file operations
- Maintain existing PyQt6, Pygments dependencies

### Architecture
- AI Agent should be implemented as a separate service class
- Chat interface should be a custom QWidget with message model
- MCP integration should provide secure file system access
- Workflow automation should leverage existing rule-based system

### Configuration
- Azure AI credentials must be loaded from .env file
- AI model parameters should be configurable
- File access permissions must be properly scoped
- Error handling for AI service unavailability

### Performance
- Chat messages should load incrementally for large conversations
- File operations should be asynchronous to prevent UI blocking
- AI responses should stream for better user experience
- Memory usage should be monitored for long chat sessions

## Success Metrics

1. **Workflow Efficiency**: Reduce manual PRD creation time by 80%
2. **Task Management**: Achieve 95% accuracy in automatic task completion marking
3. **User Adoption**: Users successfully complete end-to-end workflows without manual intervention in 90% of cases
4. **System Reliability**: AI service uptime of 99%+ during development sessions
5. **Response Quality**: AI responses are contextually relevant 95% of the time
6. **File Operations**: Zero data loss incidents during AI file operations

## Open Questions

1. Should the AI have any rate limiting or usage quotas to manage Azure costs?
2. What level of error reporting should be shown to users when AI operations fail?
3. Should there be a manual override system for AI-generated PRDs and tasks?
4. How should the AI handle conflicts when multiple developers work on the same project?
5. What backup/recovery mechanisms should be in place for AI-modified files?
6. Should the AI maintain any local knowledge base or rely entirely on the Azure model?
7. What authentication/authorization model should be used for the AI agent?

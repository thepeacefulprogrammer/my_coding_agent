# Product Requirements Document: MCP Client Interface Simplification

## Introduction/Overview

Transform the current complex AI agent application into a focused MCP (Model Context Protocol) client interface that serves as a communication conduit between developers and an external AI agent architecture. The current application has become unmaintainable with slow development cycles and prolonged test execution times due to its monolithic architecture mixing UI concerns with AI agent logic.

**Goal**: Create a clean, maintainable client interface that handles MCP communication, streaming responses, and rich message display while delegating all AI agent logic to an external service.

## Goals

1. **Reduce Codebase Complexity**: Achieve 65-70% code reduction by removing AI agent logic
2. **Improve Maintainability**: Separate UI concerns from AI processing through clear architectural boundaries
3. **Accelerate Development**: Enable faster feature development by focusing on client-side functionality
4. **Optimize Test Performance**: Reduce test execution time by eliminating complex AI service testing
5. **Enable Separation of Concerns**: Allow independent development of AI agent architecture and client interface

## User Stories

**As a developer working on a codebase:**
- I want to send queries to an AI agent through a clean chat interface so that I can get assistance with my code
- I want to see streaming responses in real-time so that I can follow the AI's reasoning process
- I want to view MCP tool call visualizations so that I can understand what actions the AI is taking
- I want to see properly formatted code blocks in responses so that I can easily read and copy code snippets
- I want the interface to be responsive and fast so that my development workflow isn't interrupted

**As a developer maintaining the client application:**
- I want a simplified codebase so that I can quickly understand and modify the client functionality
- I want fast-running tests so that I can iterate quickly during development
- I want clear separation between client and AI concerns so that I can work on UI improvements independently

## Functional Requirements

### Core Communication
1. The system must establish and maintain a connection to a single MCP server
2. The system must send user queries to the MCP server through the established connection
3. The system must receive and process streaming responses from the MCP server
4. The system must handle connection failures gracefully and provide clear error messages
5. The system must support MCP protocol message formatting and parsing

### User Interface
6. The system must provide a chat interface for user input and message display
7. The system must display streaming text responses in real-time as they are received
8. The system must render formatted code blocks within chat messages
9. The system must display MCP tool call visualizations when tool calls are executed
10. The system must maintain the current theme system (dark/light themes)
11. The system must preserve the existing code viewer functionality for browsing files
12. The system must maintain the file tree component for project navigation

### Message Processing
13. The system must parse metadata from MCP responses to determine display formatting
14. The system must distinguish between different message types (text, code, tool calls)
15. The system must maintain chat history during the session
16. The system must handle various response formats (plain text, structured data, code blocks)

### Configuration
17. The system must allow configuration of the MCP server connection details
18. The system must store connection settings persistently
19. The system must validate MCP server connectivity before attempting communication

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **AI Agent Logic**: No internal AI processing, model management, or agent orchestration
2. **Memory Management**: No conversation memory, context management, or RAG systems
3. **Project History**: No long-term project history storage or retrieval
4. **Multi-Server Support**: No support for connecting to multiple MCP servers simultaneously
5. **File Operations**: No direct file system operations (delegated to external AI agent)
6. **Code Viewer Integration**: No automatic code display based on MCP responses
7. **Backwards Compatibility**: No support for existing AI agent configurations or data
8. **Advanced MCP Features**: Focus on basic query/response patterns, not complex MCP workflows

## Design Considerations

### Architecture
- **MCP Client Coordinator**: Replace `ai_agent.py` with a lightweight `mcp_client_coordinator.py`
- **Streaming Integration**: Maintain existing streaming response infrastructure
- **Component Preservation**: Keep all UI components (chat widget, message display, code viewer, file tree)
- **Theme System**: Preserve existing theme management and styling

### User Experience
- **Familiar Interface**: Maintain current chat interface design and user interactions
- **Visual Feedback**: Preserve existing loading indicators and streaming animations
- **Error Handling**: Provide clear, actionable error messages for connection and communication issues

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies to Remove
- AI service modules (`core_ai_service`, `ai_messaging_service`, `memory_context_service`, etc.)
- Memory and history systems (entire `memory/` directory)
- Internal file operations (`workspace_service`, `mcp_file_server`)
- Task parsing and internal AI logic

### Dependencies to Preserve
- MCP client infrastructure (`core/mcp/` directory)
- Streaming response handling (`core/streaming/`)
- GUI components (`gui/` directory)
- Theme management and assets

### Key Architectural Changes
- **Single Responsibility**: Client focuses solely on MCP communication and UI
- **Stateless Design**: No internal state management beyond current session
- **Service Elimination**: Remove 15-20 service files, modify 10 files significantly
- **Test Simplification**: Remove ~70% of tests, focus on MCP communication and UI functionality

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
1. **Code Reduction**: Achieve 65-70% reduction in core functionality (4,000+ lines â†’ 1,200-1,500 lines)
2. **Test Performance**: Reduce test execution time by removing complex AI service tests
3. **Test Coverage**: Maintain 100% pass rate for all tests within the reduced scope
4. **File Count**: Remove 15-20 files entirely while preserving essential functionality

### Qualitative Metrics
1. **User Testing Success**: Developers can successfully connect to external AI agent and receive responses
2. **Maintainability**: New developers can understand and modify the codebase within 1 day
3. **Development Speed**: Feature development cycle reduced due to simplified architecture
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Client and AI agent can be developed independently

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core MCP Client Creation
- Create `mcp_client_coordinator.py` with basic MCP communication
- Update chat widget to use new coordinator
- Implement streaming response handling

### Phase 2: Service Removal
- Remove AI service modules and dependencies
- Delete memory and history systems
- Clean up configuration to focus on MCP settings

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation

- Validate all functionality works with external AI agent

### Phase 4: Documentation and Cleanup
- Update README and documentation
- Remove temporary files and unused assets
- Finalize MCP integration requirements

## Open Questions

1. **MCP Protocol Version**: Which version of the MCP protocol should be supported?
2. **Connection Retry Logic**: What retry strategy should be used for failed MCP connections?
3. **Response Timeout**: What timeout values are appropriate for MCP communication?
4. **Error Recovery**: How should the client handle partial message failures during streaming?
5. **Configuration UI**: Should MCP server configuration be done through UI or config files?

### Notes

- Focus on Test-Driven Development: Write unit tests before implementing new MCP client functionality
- Preserve existing UI components (code viewer, file tree, themes) - they should work unchanged
- Run tests with `python -m pytest tests/unit/ -n auto -q --tb=line`
- Ensure backwards compatibility is NOT required - clean slate approach
- Aim for 65-70% code reduction while maintaining core functionality

# Product Requirements Document: AI Agent GOD Object Refactoring

## Introduction/Overview

The current `ai_agent.py` file is a GOD object containing 3,839 lines of code that handles multiple responsibilities including AI messaging, MCP connections, file operations, streaming, memory management, project history, and more. This monolithic structure creates challenges in testing, maintenance, and feature development, especially as we prepare to support multiple AI agents.

This refactoring will transform the monolithic `ai_agent.py` into a clean, service-oriented architecture where the AI agent becomes an orchestrator that delegates to specialized, reusable services. This will enable better testability, maintainability, and easier development of additional AI agents.

## Goals

1. **Reduce ai_agent.py complexity** by extracting remaining responsibilities into focused services
2. **Eliminate code duplication** between ai_agent.py and existing extracted services
3. **Create reusable services** that can be shared across multiple AI agents
4. **Improve testability** through better separation of concerns and dependency injection
5. **Maintain backwards compatibility** ensuring all existing tests continue to pass
6. **Establish clear service boundaries** with well-defined interfaces
7. **Enable multi-agent architecture** by making services agent-agnostic

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to add new AI agents without duplicating core functionality, so that development is faster and more consistent.

2. **As a developer**, I want to test individual components in isolation, so that I can write focused unit tests and debug issues more easily.

3. **As a developer**, I want to modify file operations without affecting streaming or memory features, so that changes are safer and more predictable.

4. **As a maintainer**, I want each service to have a single responsibility, so that I can understand and modify code more confidently.

5. **As a developer**, I want to reuse configuration, error handling, and validation logic across agents, so that behavior is consistent.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Service Extraction and Organization

1.1. **Extract Configuration Service** - Create `ConfigurationService` to handle:
   - AIAgentConfig management and validation
   - Environment variable loading and parsing
   - Configuration updates and health checks

1.2. **Extract Health Monitoring Service** - Create `HealthMonitoringService` to handle:
   - Agent health status reporting
   - MCP connection health monitoring
   - Workspace health validation
   - System diagnostics and metrics

1.3. **Extract Error Handling Service** - Create `ErrorHandlingService` to handle:
   - Error categorization and classification
   - Retry logic for failed operations
   - Error reporting and logging
   - Exception transformation

1.4. **Extract Response Formatting Service** - Create `ResponseFormattingService` to handle:
   - AIResponse object creation and formatting
   - Success/error response standardization
   - Token usage tracking
   - Response metadata management

1.5. **Consolidate File Operations** - Merge duplicate functionality with existing `WorkspaceService`:
   - Remove file operation methods from ai_agent.py
   - Ensure WorkspaceService handles all file operations
   - Eliminate validation duplication

### 2. Service Integration and Orchestration

2.1. **Transform ai_agent.py into Orchestrator** - The main AIAgent class should:
   - Delegate all operations to appropriate services
   - Maintain service instances and their lifecycle
   - Provide a unified interface for external consumers
   - Handle service coordination and communication

2.2. **Implement Dependency Injection** - Services should:
   - Accept dependencies through constructor injection
   - Be testable in isolation
   - Have clear, minimal interfaces
   - Be composable and reusable

2.3. **Establish Service Communication** - Services should:
   - Communicate through well-defined interfaces
   - Avoid direct dependencies on ai_agent.py
   - Use event-driven patterns where appropriate
   - Share common data structures

### 3. Code Duplication Elimination

3.1. **Identify and Remove Duplicated Code** between ai_agent.py and existing services:
   - File operation methods
   - MCP tool management logic
   - Configuration handling
   - Error handling patterns

3.2. **Consolidate Similar Functionality** across services:
   - Merge overlapping responsibilities
   - Standardize common patterns
   - Eliminate redundant validation

### 4. Testing Infrastructure

4.1. **Maintain Test Compatibility** - All existing tests must:
   - Continue to pass without modification
   - Maintain current test coverage levels
   - Preserve existing test interfaces

4.2. **Enable Service-Level Testing** - New services must:
   - Be unit testable in isolation
   - Have clear mock interfaces
   - Support dependency injection for testing

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Changing external interfaces** - The public methods of AIAgent should remain unchanged
2. **Rewriting existing extracted services** - Focus on using them correctly, not redesigning them
3. **Performance optimization** - Maintain current performance characteristics
4. **Adding new features** - This is purely a refactoring effort
5. **Changing PydanticAI integration** - Maintain current PydanticAI usage patterns
6. **Database or storage changes** - No changes to data persistence

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Patterns
- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Each service has a single responsibility
- **Dependency Injection**: Services receive dependencies through constructors
- **Facade Pattern**: AIAgent becomes a facade over the service layer
- **Strategy Pattern**: Use services as interchangeable strategies

### Service Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service handles one concern
- **Interface Segregation**: Services expose minimal, focused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Prefer composition for service relationships

### Integration with Existing Services
- Leverage existing services: `AIMessagingService`, `MCPConnectionService`, `WorkspaceService`, etc.
- Eliminate duplicate functionality between ai_agent.py and existing services
- Ensure proper service initialization and lifecycle management

### Testing Strategy
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing changes
- **Service Isolation**: Each service should be unit testable
- **Integration Testing**: Maintain existing integration test suite
- **Mock Services**: Create mockable interfaces for service dependencies

## Success Metrics

### Code Metrics
- **ai_agent.py line count**: Reduce from 3,839 lines to under 500 lines
- **Method complexity**: No methods over 50 lines
- **Service count**: 8-12 focused services total
- **Code duplication**: Zero duplicate method implementations

### Quality Metrics
- **Test coverage**: Maintain or improve current coverage percentage
- **Test pass rate**: 100% of existing tests must pass
- **Service testability**: Each service must have isolated unit tests
- **Documentation coverage**: All services must have clear interface documentation

### Maintainability Metrics
- **Service responsibilities**: Each service handles exactly one domain
- **Inter-service dependencies**: Minimize coupling between services
- **Reusability**: Services can be used by multiple agent types
- **Configuration simplicity**: Single source of truth for configuration

## Open Questions

1. **Service Lifecycle Management**: Should services be singletons or created per-agent instance?

2. **Event System**: Do we need an event bus for service communication, or is direct method calling sufficient?

3. **Service Discovery**: Should services be registered in a container, or managed directly by AIAgent?

4. **Configuration Inheritance**: How should agent-specific configuration override service defaults?

5. **Error Propagation**: Should services throw exceptions or return error objects?

6. **Logging Strategy**: Should each service have its own logger, or share a common logging interface?

7. **Async Patterns**: Should all service interfaces be async-first, or mixed sync/async?

8. **Service Interfaces**: Should we define abstract base classes for services, or rely on duck typing?

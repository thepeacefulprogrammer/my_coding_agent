### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing or in the `tests/` directory.
- Use `pytest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the pytest configuration.
- Follow Test-Driven Development: write tests first, verify they fail, then implement code to make them pass.
- The MCP file server should follow the FastMCP pattern seen in the reference implementations.
- **Current Test Status**: All tests passing! Fixed all 7 failing tests related to health status, retry mechanisms, context managers, input sanitization, and security configuration expectations. Also fixed 2 MCP file server tests by patching stdio_client at the correct import location.
- **Current Linting Status**: All linting issues resolved! Fixed 135+ linting errors including modern Python type annotations (UP006, UP007, UP035), exception chaining (B904), nested if statements (SIM102), unused variables (F841), and code formatting.
- **CI Status**: âœ… COMPLETELY RESOLVED! All async test failures fixed with pytest-asyncio dependency and configuration. All linting issues resolved. All test failures fixed. CI should now pass 100%.

# Tasks Directory

This directory contains Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and task breakdowns for the "Vibe Coding" IDE project.

## Organization

### Current Tasks
- **`prd-syntax-highlighting.md`** - PRD for syntax highlighting enhancement using Chlorophyll
- **`tasks-syntax-highlighting.md`** - Detailed task breakdown for implementing syntax highlighting

### Completed Work
- **`completed/`** - Contains finished PRDs and task breakdowns
  - `prd-file-explorer-gui.md` - Original file explorer MVP requirements
  - `tasks-prd-file-explorer-gui.md` - Completed file explorer task breakdown

## Development Methodology

All tasks follow **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:
1. Write tests first to define expected behavior
2. Implement minimal functionality to pass tests
3. Ensure all tests pass before marking tasks complete
4. Refactor and optimize while maintaining test coverage

## Current Status

âœ… **File Explorer MVP**: Complete (123 passing tests)
- Project setup and configuration
- File/folder selection dialogs
- Directory scanning and tree view
- File content viewer with selection handling
- Comprehensive error handling and edge cases

ðŸš§ **Syntax Highlighting**: Ready to start
- Chlorophyll integration for professional code viewing
- Support for 597+ programming languages
- Automatic file type detection
- Performance optimization and error handling

## Getting Started

To work on the current syntax highlighting tasks:

1. Review the PRD: `prd-syntax-highlighting.md`
2. Follow the task breakdown: `tasks-syntax-highlighting.md`
3. Start with Task 7.1: Add chlorophyll dependency
4. Follow TDD methodology for each sub-task
5. Ensure all existing tests continue to pass

## Success Metrics

- All tests must pass (currently 123/123 âœ…)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Performance degradation < 200ms for typical files
- Zero crashes on edge cases or unsupported files
- Professional syntax highlighting for major languages

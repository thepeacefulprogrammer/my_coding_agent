### Notes

- Use Test-Driven Development: Write unit tests before implementing service functionality
- All existing tests in `tests/unit/test_ai_agent*.py` must continue to pass
- Run tests with `python -m pytest tests/unit/ -n auto -q --tb=line`
- Services should be reusable across multiple AI agent implementations
- **IMPORTANT**: Many services already exist! Focus on eliminating duplication and using existing services

## Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Extract Remaining Foundation Services (Configuration, Error Handling)
  - [x] 1.1 Implement ConfigurationService - Extract configuration logic from ai_agent.py (AIAgentConfig management, environment variable loading, validation)
  - [x] 1.2 Implement ErrorHandlingService - Extract error handling and retry logic from ai_agent.py, integrate with existing services
  - [ ] 1.3 Update ai_agent.py to use foundation services - Replace direct implementation with service delegation

- [ ] 2.0 Eliminate Code Duplication Between ai_agent.py and Existing Services (CRITICAL)
  - [ ] 2.1 Audit and map all duplicate functionality - Identify what ai_agent.py reimplements vs existing services
  - [ ] 2.2 Remove duplicate file operations - Delete ai_agent.py methods that duplicate WorkspaceService functionality
  - [ ] 2.3 Remove duplicate MCP functionality - Delete ai_agent.py methods that duplicate MCPConnectionService and ToolRegistrationService
  - [ ] 2.4 Remove duplicate streaming functionality - Delete ai_agent.py methods that duplicate StreamingResponseService
  - [ ] 2.5 Remove duplicate messaging functionality - Delete ai_agent.py methods that duplicate AIMessagingService
  - [ ] 2.6 Remove duplicate memory functionality - Delete ai_agent.py methods that duplicate MemoryContextService
  - [ ] 2.7 Remove duplicate project history functionality - Delete ai_agent.py methods that duplicate ProjectHistoryService
  - [ ] 2.8 Validate no functionality is lost - Ensure all removed methods are properly replaced by service calls

- [ ] 3.0 Extract Health Monitoring Service and System Diagnostics
  - [ ] 3.1 Implement HealthMonitoringService - Extract health monitoring logic from ai_agent.py, integrate with existing services
  - [ ] 3.2 Update diagnostic methods in ai_agent.py - Replace direct health checks with service delegation
  - [ ] 3.3 Create unified health status interface - Aggregate health status from all services

- [ ] 4.0 Transform ai_agent.py into Service Orchestrator (MAIN FOCUS)
  - [ ] 4.1 Design service composition pattern - Define how ai_agent.py will compose and coordinate existing services
  - [ ] 4.2 Implement service dependency injection - Update ai_agent.py constructor to accept existing service instances
  - [ ] 4.3 Replace all direct implementations with service delegation - Make ai_agent.py a thin wrapper over services
  - [ ] 4.4 Implement service lifecycle management - Handle initialization, connection, and cleanup of services
  - [ ] 4.5 Maintain backwards compatibility - Ensure public API remains unchanged
  - [ ] 4.6 Optimize service coordination - Minimize service calls and improve data flow

- [ ] 5.0 Validate Service Integration and Refactoring Success
  - [ ] 5.1 Update ai_agent tests to work with service orchestration - Modify tests to use service mocking
  - [ ] 5.2 Validate all existing tests pass - Ensure no functionality was broken during refactoring
  - [ ] 5.3 Measure refactoring success - Verify ai_agent.py line count reduction and complexity metrics
  - [ ] 5.4 Performance validation - Ensure refactored code maintains current performance characteristics
  - [ ] 5.5 Create service integration documentation - Document the new service-oriented architecture

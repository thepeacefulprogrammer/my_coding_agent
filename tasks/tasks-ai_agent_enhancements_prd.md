## Error Display and Status Management

### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing when possible
- Use `pytest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by pytest
- Memory system will use SQLite with FTS5 for full-text search capabilities
- Streaming implementation should be non-blocking and allow for interruption
- Code highlighting should reuse existing syntax highlighting from file viewer
- FastMCP integration must follow the official MCP protocol specification

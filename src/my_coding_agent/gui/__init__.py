"""GUI components and widgets for My Coding Agent.

This module contains GUI-specific components and widgets:
- Custom widgets (line numbers, splitters, etc.)
- Styling and themes
- Qt-specific UI components
- Widget utilities and helpers

The GUI module provides reusable components that work with the core
functionality to create a cohesive user interface.

Example:
    Basic usage of GUI components:

    >>> from my_coding_agent.gui import widgets
    >>> from my_coding_agent.gui.styles import apply_dark_theme
    >>> apply_dark_theme(app)

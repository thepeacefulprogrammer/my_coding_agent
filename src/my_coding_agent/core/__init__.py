"""Core functionality for My Coding Agent.

This module contains the core components for the code viewer application:
- Main window management
- File tree navigation
- Code viewing and syntax highlighting
- Theme management

The core module follows MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture patterns
to ensure maintainability and testability.

Example:
    Basic usage of core components:

    >>> from my_coding_agent.core import MainWindow
    >>> window = MainWindow()
    >>> window.show()
